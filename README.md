# foiled

> "Foiled structures" is an anagram of what this project aims to be: a [Discourse](https://discourse.org) client written in [Flutter] (https://flutter.dev)

Foiled is still in early development. A roadmap is coming soon here, or to the Projects tab, of what needs to be accomplished.

## Goals
 - caching, offline access to browsing and seraching discourse servers
 - handling multiple accounts (and servers) well
 - quality over quantity; "negative code"
 - performance and beauty, using [M3](https://m3.material.io)
 - [SemVer](https://semver.org) versioning, where the user interface is the "API"

## Non-goals
 - any feature that requires login (for now)
 - admin access
